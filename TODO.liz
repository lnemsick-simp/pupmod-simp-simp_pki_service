- Figure out el6 sscep problem
  - sscep enroll *succeeds* on the el6 client in the puppet-swap test,
   so it should work on el6 in the sscep test.  What is different is
   how the csr is generated.
- Figure out why certmonger test fails
  - dogtag is configured to allow the default encryption and hash
    algorithms certmonger uses when dogtag fails to respond to GetCACaps.
    So it 'should work', as well.
- Add tests to revoke and get crl
- Add sscep instructions to README
